## EXPERIENCE
#### Data Science Bootcamp, ​ [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/)​
###### Sep 2023 - Nov 2023


- Developed an engaging Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (UTTT) game leveraging Python OOP for a robust game environment. Implemented advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train models through strategic gameplay. [Github](https://github.com/KaufmannLukas/ds-ultimate-tic-tac-toe)

- Led the comprehensive evaluation of Kickstarter campaign data spanning 2009 to 2018, encompassing data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis. Proficiently identified and implemented predictive models, including GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and ElasticNetCV, enhancing accuracy in forecasting expected funding amounts through an python user interface.
